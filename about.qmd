This site was built using Quarto.

All the material was elaborated by [Thiago Cerqueira Silva](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/cerqueira-silva.thiago), based on previous solutions by Andrea Mazzella and Julian Matthewman (<https://github.com/andreamazzella/R4SME>)

Ps.: In this material, I use `|>` (native pipe operator) instead of `%>%` (magrittr pipe). You can find it in Tools-\>Global Options-\>Code-\>Use native pipe operator

Ps2.: Some confidence intervals will differ from those calculated in STATA.
